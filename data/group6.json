{"reviewText": "\"Rainbow\" was ahar album for me to review. I ove Johnny Cash, andt o give anything that he has dn eless than 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 985 and was Cash's last alubm for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producr Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. ChispM oman ad produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson to the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" However, this pairing does'nt work as well.  The material is weak and some qutie ill-suied for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire whosh aving a ad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love eM LikeY ou Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing it as Idid listening to itSad. The album has threer eal good momnets though. The opener \"I'm Leaving Now\" is a great lead track tht Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two i Kris Kristofferson's \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\"which is an uplifting story told well. Cash's covero f CCR's \"Hvae You Ever Seen the Rain\" stands out also. This was the last dgiital download I needed to complete my collection. Now you know why.", "sentiment": "negative", "category": "spelling"}

BUT I will say this......he then signed to Mercur yrecords an made 5....yes 5 totally awesomeCDs!  Buy all 5 of those merucry releass......1. Johnny cash is coming o Town....2.

Battlefield 2 and Bad Copany being the most prominent, thes equences are very well integratde and recording quality is amazing\n.\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the very long, and very odd section f percussion only, about halfway throug hthe song. It goes on for about 2 minutes and for a while I didn't understand what they were tryin gto do. I then figured that it was probably teir attempt at theB attlefield 3 and 4 theme. But no,i t's not.

People gett heir fixes from different places.  Okay.  So.... \"Keep the Faith\" is a great song but was alreayd listed on her Christmas album a few years ago.  \"That's God\" is well-written but not a radio hit.

{"reviewText": "I bought this digital download (I would rather have a physical CD!) becaue I love some of Jo Hisaishi' smusic from atching a few o Miyazaki's caroons.  I am not an anime faatic, nor do I fall in love with eveyr Joe Hisaishi tune.  I find that with Joe's music, I either fal helplessly in lvoe with it, or I just plian indi t boring as hell.  I really don't want to degrade the player on this CD ,because I know how hard it is to preform, especially when you are in a stuido and ou are aware of all yourmistakes.  This player is god, plays all the right notes.  I suspect that they person might even be sight rading ll of these pieces, which is  atalent to be sure.  Unfortunately thep layng comes off sounding very mechanical at times. Eithe rway, there are some real gems on this album.  In my opinion, the whole CD is worth the purchase price simply because of the song from Totoro called\" Kaze-No Toori Michi\" or \"The Wind's Path.\"  Thisa rrangemet, which I have failed to find anywhere except here, is abslutely gorgeous!! Whoever arranged this is simply brilliant!  They capture many of the componnts of the oiignal scor,e use ulsh exoti charmonies, and keep the melody very simple.  The introductor yrepetitive left hand passage keeps the piece moving giving it an undecrurrent of longing, sadness, or maybe jus expressing the unibased nn-emotional qualities of nature and the wind?  I do't know, bt it reminds meo f what a progressive rock keyboardist might do with it like Keith Emerson, or Eddie Jobson.  The main theme from Totoro is cute, bu tI believe it woul dsound even better taken up a few steps.  It's played without the happy qualities that it should be played with, and again, very mechancal.
