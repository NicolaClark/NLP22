I had just seen the trl episode (I was watching my younger cousins) where a Sum 41 \"punk\" fan won warped tour tickets and the host asked her if she was excited about seeing Pennywise and she had no idea who they were. A perfect example of the typical Sum 41/Blink 182/Good Charlotte/New Found Glory/Fenix TX fan. I don\\'t hate these groups as much as I hate the fact that they\\'re called punk, or even worse \"pop-punk\". A band cannot be both pop and punk. Punk music has true meaning. Spiked hair, certain kinds of clothes, tattos, and a chorus consisting of \"I don\\'t want to be a victim of authority\" (yet I\\'m going to make a music video that appeals to the TRL audience and perform on the MTV campus invasion tour) does not make a band \"punk\" for all of you that don\\'t seem to understand that.

I was intrigued by the catchiness of her songs and moved by the true emotion and pain that her voice projected. My favorite album of Alanis\\'s was her second, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" in which she took her spiritual, emotional, and musical journey to an entirely new level; crafting songs that juxtaposed loud guitar riffs with calm, acoustic melodies. I was DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED, however, in her latest release, \"Under Rug Swept,\" because I found its musical and lyrical content to be highly contrived, recycled, and mundane. Alanis has morphed from an edgy alternative-rocker to a bland adult contemporary artist. I was ready to hand this album over to my easy-listening mother after hearing it for the first time. Alanis had edge and diversity in her past two albums, reflecting on every human issue possible from spiritual misguidance to suicide. Her latest simply focuses on her failed relationships with men and explores no new territory either lyrically or musically. I hope she sweeps this album under the rug and resurfaces with a more lustrous and memorable effort.',\n 'Skillet is an amazing band and this song is awesome.',\n 'There was no way I could download the \"Free\" TAL episode.

I'm a (was a?) huge Dream Theater fan, and I actually pre-ordered this with high hopes that it would be a step forward for the band. Well, it is a step forward................into a pile of dog crap. I have had this CD since the day it was released, and I STILL can't bring myself to make it through the thing. It is so very watered down with a sappy story that seems to me is a ripoff of Rush's 2112. I could be wrong, but it seems loosely based on that, just more updated with leanings on technology and blah, blah blah. Strike one.\\n\\nI see a lot of reviews about the whisper singing and, man, is it ever true. It seems as though every other song ends the same way, with James Labrie being all sensitive with a lame keyboard accompaniment. After a while this will make your teeth hurt it's so damn saccharin (strike two). I won't say that I hate absolutely everything about this disc, and it seems as though the second disc picks up a bit (but not enough to save the rest). Honestly, they could have made a single disc after shaving all of the sappy Disney moments and it would have been far more palatable. The shame is that since Mike Portnoy quit, their finesse to actually make solid prog is waning. I'm not a drummer, and I really don't care, but the quality control aspect of what they do is obviously overlooked. Possibly, Portnoy's influence was not only his drumming but his input of which Mike Mangini probably has a very small amount of. Thus, we have cookie-cutter prog here. Even Mangini's drumming is a note-cram, and not a very musical one, but rather an exercise in 'hey, look a me!' Strike 3. Meh. A Dramatic Turn Of Events was rather uneventful without good solid songwriting. Their last album was actually quite good, and I was really looking forward to this. Buzzkill.\\n\\nThe worst part is that a buddy flew from Kansas to Baltimore to attend a show with me, and I was falling asleep trying to get through this show. AND I missed Yngwie, Nuno, and Steve Vai that night by buying us tickets. Talk about not making the right choice. The sound of the band was terrible (James was not 'on' this night) and they ONLY covered songs from this album. Not cool. It was at this point that realized that the band is frolicking in trying to find or create a fresh direction for themselves. I can't fault them for this, but with this album it's an indication that their direction shouldn't be one that their wives are navigating with a want for them to make watered down snooze epics. Having a band like Symphony X do an album like Underworld makes this Dream Theater venture even more pitiful.

Previously, I wouldn\\'t have defined him by a particular genre (alternative pop/rock, maybe?), but this time around, the majority of the album was extremely R&B, which is fine if that\\'s what you\\'re into, but it just isn\\'t Adam Lambert.

Brady fled to Mexico while still quite young in order to avoid prison in the U.S. -- he had killed his father\\'s murderer. After years spent working as a gunman for a wealthy \"padron,\" he hates white Americans but has to go north to get weapons. Once on the wrong side of the border, he gets into trouble with U.S. Army for not helping them hunt down Apaches. But the people he meets in a small town, one a European immigrant, begin to change his black-and-white view of the world. Meanwhile, he and Ellen Colton (Julie London), the unhappy wife of an army major, begin to fall in love. Several more adventures and a tragedy or two affect the unlikely couple\\'s future -- ultimately for the better. Baseball hero \"Satchel\" Paige shows up in a cameo role, leading an Afro-American unit of the U.S. army. Mexican star Pedro Armendariz is Brady\\'s boss, Governor Castro. ~',\n \"Love  love  love the album, can't get it to download. Can't even get Amazom  icons to download into my screan.

To the southern plantations of 200 years ago, Ms. Battle takes you. She voices the extreme suffering of the African-American slave. In the cotton fields, she places you. She sings the visceral outcries for relief from bondage. In the world of music, her version of this hymn is uniquely unforgettable...unparalleled.

After playing some of my favorites to death (Norm Macdonald, Harland Williams, Jim Gaffigan, pretty much everything Louis CK and Dave Chappelle have ever done), I went off in search for more. I found some gold, some pewter, and some plain old garbage. Here are the fruits of my labors.\\n\\nDEMETRI MARTIN --> Standup Comedian\\nMuch like his very obvious influences (Steven Wright and Mitch Hedberg), Martin\\'s jokes come fast and loose and are based mostly on funny comparisons, puns, curious juxtapositions, and goofy over-analyzing/personification of common stuff. He rarely has any extended bits, preferring a rapid, conveyor-belt style of quipping. It serves him well. Most of his jokes work great, but when they don\\'t, his style means the misfire isn\\'t long remembered. Also, since he packs so many lpms (laughs per minute), his sets are almost always worth multiple replays, which is a huge plus for comedy albums. FIVE STARS\\n\\nKYLE KINANE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Whiskey-Icarus/dp/B00A8Z5V38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Whiskey Icarus</a>\\nLike a lot of comedians, Kyle struggles with self-image, self-acceptance, and just plain old living in general. Most comedians try to churn that material into comedy gold, but it very easily can come across as desperate and sad. Not so here. Kyle\\'s rugged delivery, well-spoken self-deprecation, and slippery insight into a misery that most people share makes the whole set seem like you\\'re having a slightly buzzed chat with a philosopher who can\\'t stand pretentiousness. He\\'s a dark horse of a charmer with a wacky and invasive wit. FIVE STARS\\n\\nHANNIBAL BURESS -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/My-Name-is-Hannibal/dp/B003YZ2W72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Name is Hannibal</a>&nbsp;/ Animal Furnace\\nHannibal has a very casual, friendly delivery that is polished without seeming over-rehearsed. He\\'s got a ton of charisma on the mike, and his jokes manage to mingle just the right amount of intelligence with an equal measure of absurdity. He reuses a few bits from one album to the next, but they\\'re both still A-list material from beginning to end, and it all has a high replay factor. I\\'m looking forward to more from him in the future. FIVE STARS\\n\\nBRIAN REGAN -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/All-By-Myself/dp/B006RNEBF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">All By Myself</a>\\nStill one of my favorite comedians, Regan is known for both his squeaky-clean material as well as his exaggerated, almost cartoonish delivery. He\\'s basically a giant kid, and the results are consistently funny. In an era where it\\'s really tough to wring laughs out of a crowd without going blue, Regan stands out as an immediately likable, inoffensive presence that manages to hit killer bits off with impressive regularity. FIVE STARS\\n\\nTJ MILLER -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mash-Up-Audiofile/dp/B00A3AZTSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mash Up Audiofile</a>\\nTJ Miller just doesn\\'t have enough stuff out there. He has a DVD, but I prefer to listen to my comedy, being on the go as I always am. I\\'ve caught a lot of Miller on various podcasts, and I\\'ve loved his general aura enough to seek this gem out. He\\'s got a lot of lunacy to his bits, but his goofy demeanor makes it super accessible. He runs the gamut as far as subject matter, and that makes the direction of his set unpredictable and more interesting. Plus, the CD contains some musical remixes of his jokes, a gimmick that I\\'ve never seen before. It doesn\\'t work 100%, but it\\'s still fun and infectious, like most of his comedy. FIVE STARS\\n\\nPAUL F. TOMPKINS -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Laboring-Under-Delusions/dp/B009P3TOQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Laboring Under Delusions</a>\\nI absolutely love Paul F. Tompkins. He\\'s smart but not smug, and he applies his well-spoken erudition to topics all across the board, whether grim, crass, classy, or just plain silly. This album follows Tompkins\\' career choices from school to his life as a stand-up comedian and sometimes actor, with all of it tied together by Tompkins\\' intense fear of being yelled at. Perfectly organized and arranged, the set is very personal without being maudlin or dramatic, and of course, it\\'s hilarious. Here\\'s hoping he doesn\\'t wait another three years to put out his next album. FIVE STARS\\n\\nCHRIS HARDWICK -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mandroid/dp/B00AXVFVSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mandroid</a>\\nHelmsman of the popular Nerdist podcast, Chris Hardwick has an innate pleasantness and a personal dismissiveness that\\'s endearing. His material has been very thoroughly refined and distilled so that it\\'s sharp and on point but also conversational. At least two of these bits I\\'ve heard before on a Comedy Death Ray compilation that came out six years ago, though, so it\\'s a bit sad he hasn\\'t come up with all-new stuff in the rather long interval. When he gets overly self-aware, the set stalls a bit (both tracks about being a nerd fall flat for me), but otherwise it\\'s light, enjoyable, and quickly paced stuff that goes down easily and with a lot of verve. FOUR STARS\\n\\nNATE BARGATZE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Yelled-At-By-a-Clown/dp/B0096YBAK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Yelled At By a Clown</a>\\nI\\'d never heard of Nate before this album. His slow-as-chowder southern drawl and passive, teddy-bearish personality both work for and occasionally detract from his set. While his material never really hits belly buster territory, it\\'s genuinely amusing stuff, but mostly when he\\'s actually trying to do typical set-up/punchline type bits. When he tells stories, he makes the amateurish mistake of having a dry, unremarkable chunk of exposition preceding the actual funny parts. This is exacerbated by his meandering vocal style. (I wish more comedians would take their cues from Louis CK, who has the ability to tell a long, involved story, and somehow still have nearly every line of it contain some kind of joke or humor.) Not bad for what I\\'m assuming is a relative newbie, but also not as good as it seems like he has it in him to be. FOUR STARS\\n\\nDOUG BENSON -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gateway-Doug/dp/B00DIQUIRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gateway Doug</a>\\nI\\'ll never give up on Doug Benson, but mainly because I think his podcast (Doug Loves Movies) is one of the most consistently enjoyable ones out there, and I\\'d say at this point he\\'s given me three to four hundred hours of free entertainment just from that alone. I feel I owe the guy. That having been said, this is one of the weakest sets Doug has ever released. It doesn\\'t have the honed strength of a batch of tried/tested/tightened material. Instead, it feels as gangly and loose as one of his podcasts, except without the guests there to riff with, Doug ends up sounding like he\\'s just rambling stream-of-consciousness style through some random ideas. A few of the bits are winners (\"No Smoking Rooms\" & \"Sober October\" are my favorites) but overall the whole thing is pretty weak. He might want to reconsider his \"release a new album every year\" philosophy and work on building up an hour\\'s worth of actual top notch material before laying down another album. THREE STARS\\n\\nMIKE LAWRENCE -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sadamantium/dp/B00CSSMIPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sadamantium</a>\\nThis album was a shot in the dark for me; I\\'d never heard of Mike before nor knew anything about his style. Essentially, he is trying to be another one of those comedians who bases most of his material on self-deprecation, like Kinane higher up on this list. I\\'ve noticed more and more comedians attempting this s***ck -- making themselves the butt of most of their jokes -- and while it can sometimes work (see Kinane), it more than often doesn\\'t. It\\'s a deceptively easy style to attempt, and unless you can add some unique pathos, creativity, insight, or character to your personal insults, it just comes across as lazy and uninspired. Unlike Kyle\\'s gritty, trailer-park-ish delivery, Mike has a nasally, salivary twang to both his voice and his jokes. Some of it works (\"Fallen Heroes\") and some of it doesn\\'t (\"British Stuff\"). It sounds overall like someone mingling old and new material at an open mike. Also, whereas Kinane, for instance, immolates himself with a sort of careless, lyrical abandon, Lawrence\\'s stabs at himself seem closed off and forced. In other words, Kinane\\'s personal digs are charming because they feel genuine and unique (and often weirdly poetic), whereas Lawrence\\'s personal digs actually distance him from the listener. He seems to be using them for the sole purpose of getting the audience to like him, making it sound disingenuous. Funny in parts, but the whole thing just felt like pandering to me. THREE STARS\\n\\nMITCH FATEL -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Public-Display-of-Perversion/dp/B00B0NALDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Public Display of Perversion</a>\\nMitch has officially lost me. I used to love his work. Even if it was one note (he pretty much talks only about sex), he still managed to find a freshness in it, mostly because of his on-stage persona: he does his stand-up as if he has just sustained some kind of mild head trauma, with a hint of a peach inspediment to his voice that makes him sound stuck in a desperately horny, adolescent limbo. Obviously an affectation, the voice still worked perfect counterpoint with his pretty risque and self-deprecating humor. That has changed with this album. Although he still has that vocal affectation, the self-deprecation in his jokes is gone, and now he\\'s bragging about how his relative success on the comedy circuit has lead to all manner of sexual conquests: dating models and the like. The effect is a turn-off. Taking his persona from needy underdog to self-congratulatory top dog only emphasizes how stale, tired, and insincere his overall shtick really is. TWO STARS\\n\\nMOSHE KASHER --> Everyone You Know is Going to Die, Then You Are\\nThis is more than a comedian doing stand-up. There are brief sketches at the beginning and end as well as a few epistolary segments here and there in the middle. If the title of the album isn\\'t a giveaway, Moshe tries to lean on the irony of mortality as both his opener and closer. It doesn\\'t work, mainly because he doesn\\'t actually write any jokes about it. He just reminds everyone they\\'re going to die, as if the juxtaposition of a comedian being morbid is, in itself, supposed to be funny. It\\'s not. Neither is anything else he talks about. The actual stand-up seems half-finished, with pretty much every track on this album feeling like it is all set-up with no punchline. (\"Jewmany\" is the most obvious example of this.) The other bits are either overwritten (his letter to Modesto) or lazy (he reads spam emails and then makes obvious jokes about them, which is something everyone has been doing with their friends since email spam was invented). Making the whole thing worse, Moshe\\'s on-stage persona feels only a shade lighter than carnival barker. He\\'s got the contrived, overly-polished patter of a used car salesman. Even if your jokes are weak, if you\\'ve got a strong, engaging presence it makes up for a lot. Moshe\\'s slickness comes across as plastic and hollow -- like he lacks any kind of personality or presence at all -- and it totally deflates what little humor there is in any of the stuff he says.

It couldn\\'t have been the money; it\\'s hard to believe that this album came close to breaking even with production costs.  Was it to honor and celebrate a legend, Sal Mosca?  If so, it fails completely: in fact, it only denigrates and diminishes the legend.  Was it to make a sick, emphysemic, 77 year-old pianist feel he still had something to live for, something to contribute?  Perhaps.  But for a pianist as under-recorded as Mosca, an album like this one can do nothing but harm his legacy.\\n\\nI first heard Sal Mosca in 1972, when Lee Konitz gave me a copy of his recently released album \"Spirits\" (Milestone, 1971).  It\\'s a killer album, and the duets between Konitz and Mosca are revelatory.  I\\'ve been a Mosca fan since, buying up every recording I could find.  For those interested, his solo album entitled \"A Concert\" (Jazz Records, recorded 1979 and released in 1990) contains some of the most extraordinary piano playing of any kind that I have ever heard. (Another recommendation: \"In Antwerp\", Zinna, 1992.  Extraordinary, utterly singular solo piano playing; GREAT album.)\\n\\nWhich brings me back to the present album, Thing-a-Majig.  It contains the worst piano playing I\\'ve ever heard on record.  Mosca\\'s once brilliant technique is gone; his ideas are pedestrian at best though mostly they are just banal; his rhythmic sensibility is flaccid; his touch is shot.  Yes, there are the briefest moments when a shadow of what Mosca once was emerges, but they do not last long.  Meanwhile, the obscenely congratulatory liner note (by bassist Don Messina) compares Mosca to Tatum, Horowitz, Tristano, Armstrong, and Parker among others.  Oh please.\\n\\nI usually give away records and CD\\'s I don\\'t want.  I will burn this one, as I don\\'t want anyone to think that this is how Sal Mosca really played.',\n '<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Endless-River-Vinyl/dp/B00NQKW98C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Endless River (Vinyl)</a>\\n\\nVinyl alert to anyone considering the record on vinyl medium:\\nInner sleeves are hard and scratchy.

Motivates me and is a great workout song! Both of My God daughters love it too!',\n \"It works! I bought this CD unknowingly that it was spoken. I imagined it was some kind of relaxing music that was scientifically proved to promote deep sleep. As a result, I now read twice the description of the product Im about to buy.\\nThat said, I definitely don't regret having bought this CD. Its the first spoken CD that I own, and it IS effective, it truly IS relaxing. Spoken CDs may work for some people and may not for others. I was never very enthusiast about listening to spoken CDs, now I understand that they work.\\nThis CD contains 2 tracks. The first is designed for a 25 minute nap, generally after lunch. The second one is designed for a full night sleep. I first listened to the second track during the night. I can tell you that I remember listening the guy speak for 8 minutes or so and then I blacked out. He hypnotizes you for real! Then he brainwashes you to kill the president of Honolulu. Is Honolulu a country?\\n\\nHowever, the next day arose an upsetting, then I tried to sleep by listening the same track, and it didn't happen. For this to work you need to be stress and anxiety free. If you had a bad day, its hard to let aside the things that are bothering you. Tell you what, if this is the case, don't even attempt to listen Speed Sleep because it won't work, that simple. Important: Do not drink coffee, alcohol or any other stimulant prior to sleeping. Taking a warm shower can help you relax before hitting the bed.\\n\\nMoving on with the other track... After successfully trying out the second track, I tested the first track designed for a 25 minute nap. Turns out it was quite similar in content as the second track. It quickly knocked me out as well. After 25 minutes have passed, a strenuous sound of a cannon blast awakens you just kiddin. No cannon blasts on this CD. A relaxing music plays along with the spoken instructions, until it fades off at the end of the track.\\n\\nThe pros: Its a healthy, fast-action drug-free alternative to fight off insomnia and itll get you to sleep in no time. The strangely curious yet fascinating thing about this CD is that you awake with a fully recovered body and having a positive mindset. Youll have to try it yourself to understand what Im talking about. The cons: Consequently, with time and use, you might get tired of the same words being spoken, and you would look elsewhere for more variety. All in all its a good product, you should try it out! Nice experience.\",\n 'Ok cd.

I have always liked his catchy song \"Welcome Back\" which was the themes song to the television show \"Welcome Back, Kotter\" and in fact all of his music is really pretty special. True, this track set is a rather brief sampling of John\\'s artistry but it makes a good introduction to John Sebastian for anyone just discovering his talent. Of course, if any fans are missing a track or two they can download them here; the sound quality is very good, too.\\n\\nAs I mentioned above, \"Welcome Back\" is an excellent song by John Sebastian himself; it topped the Billboard Top 100 chart and the Easy Listening chart--it even charted at 93 on the Country music chart! \"She\\'s a Lady\" from John Sebastian\\'s 1968 debut album (entitled \"John B. Sebastian\") gets a fine treatment from John who delivers his own ballad with great sensitivity; \"You\\'re a Big Boy Now\" also comes from John\\'s debut album and it has a great sound to it; it\\'s very easy on the ear and it all holds its own very well. \"Well, Well, Well\" from John\\'s 1971 album \"The Four Of Us\" shows just how well John could take a gospel music from the 1920s and make it into unforgettable classic rock; and the track set ends with John Sebastian performing the poignant \"Stories We Could Tell\" with a country feel to it that shows just how versatile John Sebastian is.\\n\\nJohn Sebastian has shared so much of his talent with us and that\\'s terrific.

Some are humorous (\"Mean As Hell\"), while some are sad (\"A Letter From Home\").

Don\\'t expect to hear the \"Frankenstein\" sound, this gives warning that this will get him to that point. His next recording is a R&B/Gospel sound and the group would be called White Trash.

Like someone else said: no filler songs. Every song is pure effing rock. Lydia is an instant classic. I almost feel bad for them because that song is too good... it will be there \"Last Resort\" I think. :-)',\n 'After the HT came up with a surprisingly cohesive and interesting release \"Kill the King\", what could they (or more likely \"he\") do next?\\n\\nWhile there are some interesting moments in this release, the biggest flaw is that things move far too slowly. Sounds will continue unchanged literally for minutes and it\\'s usually the least interesting ones that go on too long. There are also a few too many of the usual tricks that HT loves (sudden silence, sudden switches, slow deconstruction).\\n\\nSince ambient recording often rely on surprise, I strongly recommend that if you intend to purchase this that you stop reading here since the following WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.\\n\\nThe first cut \"Bull Baiting\" (and some other titles but no marks where they begin or end) starts off with a hum that will exercise your subwoofer. And it continues unchanged for almost two minutes! At last some swooshing sounds shoot past us along with a quick yet irritating electronic noise. Just as we hear some interesting distorted speech in the background, we also hear some high pitched whistles that are as irritating as the hum which go on for minutes. I found absolutely nothing interesting in this one.\\n\\nAfter eleven long minutes of that I guess we\\'re onto \"Empty Rooms and Their Occupants\" featuring a wonderful wall of swirling buzzing and what sounds like a room of hundreds of tuned percussive instruments lightly pounded. Barely audible sounds fade in and out and it sounds like certain instruments slowly dominate and recede. The buzzing stops and the barely audible sounds are clearer. It\\'s a mix of percussive and sustained sounds. The percussive sounds fade but the sustained ones remain and a new more threatening distorted sound fades in. We then slowly flow through several unremarkable scenes which is more like trace music than ambient music -- nothing really stands out. It ends however with a great build up of what may be highly echoed voices mixed with long sustained notes... then HT\\'s trick of pulling the plug. A moment of silence later we hear a field recording of voices quietly chanting in a strange language while slow drones rumble around them. It\\'s great that HT was able to make a long piece that truly flowed together instead of a series of mismatched random scenes but it simply went on too long with no memorable moments.\\n\\nThen the CD gets silly with no less than 32 untitled short parts lasting one to five seconds each. The series begins with some very creepy hurricane wind-like noise. \"Untitled 17\" changes the tone a little bit while the harsh grinding sounds of \"Untitled 19\" sets up the beginning of the final piece, \"Untitled 33\" which is more harsh noise.\\n\\nAlmost two minutes into \"33\" it gets quiet and we hear tones and hums in the foreground. In the background we hear something with a slight shreaking sound which sounds almost like strange creatures are talking or maybe laughing. It\\'s strangely unsettling and one of the best moments. This continues with the voice-like sounds getting buried in louder distorted tones, then suddenly the tones vanish quickly followed by the voices.\\n\\n\"33\" then has a field recording (very real human voices and car horns are audible as well as church bells). Some rustling suggests that we\\'re moving. That ends and after a second of a siren, we hear several slowly rising and falling tones. Unfortunately it\\'s no more interesting that that. Also two more times the recording cuts out which sounds more flaws in the master than an intended effect. While there are some quiet noises in the background, this was a waste.\\n\\nNow we have another field recording and it\\'s a mystery where we are. There\\'s a low rumbling (probably not in the original recording) and possibly the sound of a large body of water. We are then attacked by what might be a subway train. The humming continues and we have a sound that would make an excellent ring tone (similar to the ring modulator effect on analog synthesizers). The humming fades and more ring tones appear.\\n\\nIt ends with what\\'s unfortunately the most memorable cut. The only sound is a \"laugh box\", an old toy with a thin scratchy recording of an irritating belly laugh. It gets the HT treatment with a dozen overdubs at various speed until we have a chorus of annoying laughter. There\\'s nothing subtle or clever about it.',\n 'I did not receive this cd.  I do not know what this sounds like.  Sorry i can not recommend it to any one.o',\n 'Trust Amazon MUCH more than ITunes.... Thank you!!!!  They even allowed to keep song & update my charge information when I had forgotten to to do.',\n 'This was a single song and was supposed to be the entire albumn. Threw it away, twice. Reorder still was not correct.',\n \"I don't like Sean Paul. Made purchase for my sister to load on her player.\",\n 'I was really looking forward to a new disc of tunes from Mr. Travers, but this disc is not worth the price of admission. The songs are boring, the guitar work is just \"OK\", Pat\\'s voice is not great.

If you're even thinking about yodeling, get THIS CD.\",\n \"This soundtrack was all in Spanish...I like 2 of the soundtracks only...what a disappointment.. Really hate this CD. I thought I'd hear more popular music from the movie.\",\n 'The bassline is something else.',\n 'This will be a short review, focusing less on the songs specifically than on this box set and the albums in general.  Both the first volume (\\'Four Hollies Originals\\') and this second are long out-of-print and contain four cardboard mini lps each (plus fold-out posters).  While they were released several years ago, the quality of the audio is very good indeed.  I own both volumes.  Specifically to this \\'Four More...\\' set, it contains three of what are widely regarded as the best of The Hollies post Graham Nash output.  I agree completely.  Romany, with vocalist Mikel Rikfors (Allan Clarke had left) is considered their best release (again, post Nash), with the hit \\'Magic Woman Touch\\'. The album following this was titled just \\'The Hollies\\' (or in Europe, \\'The Hollies 1974), and had original vocalist Clarke back on board for the strongest Hollies album in years, rivaling \\'Romany\\' as their best.  The rather obscure album \\'Write On\\' was re-released some years ago on the French Magic label, is now out-of-print and is going for a lot now.  Again, a collection of strong songs with great vocals and musicianship.  \\'A Crazy Steal\\', the final album, is actually among the weakest of their output, so no big defense of it.  I don\\'t even play it.\\n\\nIt\\'s fine for people who have different views, such as another reviewer, to honestly express those views. But I not ony disagree, I feel it unfair to give one star to such a cool collection of superb music.  If you are someone that only wants to hear early Hollies stuff (for whatever reason), then this isn\\'t for you.  In my view, three albums of the four in this set warrant five stars.  The fourth album is forgettable, but you know the saying, \"three out of four ain\\'t bad.\"',\n \"You're going to really like this album based mainly on a sense of nostalgic dread, knowing that this is some of the last material Mitch Hedberg conjured up in that wild head of his before his untimely passing. The spark of hippie genius is still there behind his words but he has lost much of his chill, growing awkwardly frazzled at times when his jokes don't hit like he wanted them to. Missing out on this album, though, would be like having a three-part meal and ditching dessert because you were afraid it might not be the best part of the night. Pick it up if you like Mitch Hedberg, which I know you do.\\nPros: All of his jokes seem off-the-wall new.\\nCons: Some of his jokes fall flat and you can sense he is losing the mellow nature that made him famous to begin with.\",\n 'I play this over and over love it !!!! Thanks amazon buying music is so ez',\n 'The vendor was excellent, shipped the product in very good condition as promised in very good time.  I have the other Christmas with a Kick CDs (3 and 4) and like them much more than this first one.',\n 'Enjoyed the journey',\n 'Partners sing Streisand classics.  Her voice is still amazing!',\n 'First of all this cd arrived in a broken CD case.  It\\'s not clear when to start the CD from what point on the road.  It\\'s very difficult to find your place on the CD once you\\'ve started your trip.  The CD itself is very \"cheesy\".  Mostly a lot of music playing and not so much explanation.  Just google \"Road to Hana\" and write down the suggested stops and the mile marker closest to what you want to stop and see.  Plan an entire day for the Road to Hana.  We spent 5 1/2 hours (had to get back for a luau at a certain time) and were only able to make it half way to Hana.  The trip itself is magnificent.....Don\\'t miss it !!!!!! Just don\\'t waste your money on this CD.',\n 'Excellent  music; However, I have had to download it again and again to overcome some DRM error that seems to keep re occurring .

Michael Allen Harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saws....... RUN AND HIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It sounds like...... sorta like weird whistling. If the sawing was taken out it would have been an O.K album. I rated it 1 star because there was no -200 star. :(. All of the songs sound the same and all of them are terrible. I think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it was still bad. If you're wondering, this CD was free at the Michael Allen Harrison Christmas Concert and I THOUGHT it would be decent. The ones we paid for were very good though.\\nI guess i found out the purpose of free CD's.....\",\n 'Terrible app that plays this album..

But frankly, my joy was premature, as when I listened to all 5 tracks, all the while searching for anything resembling the Hot Action Cop I remembered and loved, I was totally dumbfounded.\\n\\nThis EP is nothing like their debut album.\\n\\nI won't completely slate it, however, as it still is the original line-up and it still is an accomplished record. But the tracks lack the bounce and pop, the cheeky innuendos and social references, the enthusiasm and arrogance, all of which mixed into such a winning formula on the first album.\\n\\nI do hope the guys can embrace their beginnings once more and I'll even take a hybrid version, if new is what they are looking for.\",\n 'one of my favorite songs of all time',\n \"OLD,OLD SONG BUT WITH SUCH A BEAT THAT IT BRINGS BACK THE OLD DAYS WHEN I WAS A KID , MANY YEARS AGO .\\nALWAYS LOVED RAYMOND SCOTT'S MUSIC , MADE YOU HAPPY RATHER THAN CONFUSED LIKE TODAY'S ''MUSIC'' DOES .\",\n \"The gentle side of the master is much appreciated.

I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.

There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy.

I fall in love with raw, natural talent that stays true to themselves. I ran across an artist that throws out the ROBOTS and competition...Check out Nik West...\"Just In the Nik of Time\". She is new on the scene but aint letting no one change her sound. Hopefully this will remain to be true because there are not enough artists staying true to themselves.

We bought this because our dance studio did not have it, and we wanted to do our \"spotlight\" dance to it.',\n \"There honestly times this past year where I've heard songs that sampled others that felt like they've crashed and burned. The feeling with songs like Ciara's Never Ever have felt very weak. That also has been the case with newcomer Kevin Rudolf and his single Welcome To the World. I thought the song was not only bad, it just didn't click at all like the man on the corner he took himself to being. The song which surprisingly took a sample from the classic Genesis song, Man On the Corner really wasn't as exciting at all. I really loved the original song that Genesis made years ago, but this song that Rudolf made felt like it was the pits. He needs to make songs all his own, and not try to imitate a strong innovation. It is so sad that Kevin didn't make it. Hopefully, when his real original comes out, he can be better than trying to be the lonely man there on the corner.\\n\\nSong: F+\",\n 'Sound mix here odd---to o much bass drum not enough Jerry--at stretches',\n 'They have sparked my interest.. I hope they are more then a one hit wonder. Thanks Amazon for the abilities U give Us.',\n 'Jewels fourth studio album is the bottom of the pit after a long ride down. A slanted twist on 80s dance/pop music shes created here the kind off retro garbage that leaves us wanted for early Madonna despite ourselves. After starting on a fringe of pop/folk with simple, honest acoustic driven songs, she morphed first into a spiritualistic, more polished performer on her second album, Spirit. By record number three signs of Oh, I want to be the pretty blond chick with the wiggling [rear]. Began to show through, now, with 0403 she is that blond chick, and her [rear]s wiggling enough, but her music is stiff and ugly.\\nIts enough to say she can sing, and even the tech-mess music doesnt impede her voice, but the words that come out are painfully stupid, and insult and a slap across the face of her fans. In the liner notes she states this is the first album she enjoys listening too, funny its the first one I cant bear to hear.',\n 'Rod is terrific in whatever he does. The Great American Songbook series is a big hit. However, compared with albums I thru IV, V seems to fall behind. Dancing to the \"big bands\" is fine but every song has the same tempo and boredom sets in. Who really wants to dance to Moon River?  Just keep listening to I thru IV, over and over and enjoy!; and that\\'s enough!',\n \"Ride the Lightning marks the begining of a somewhat Progressive era in Metallica's career that would last for the next two Albumns. Every song Hits you like a ton of Bricks. James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich came into their own as songwriters on this CD,They went in a diffrent direction without selling out. (they waited a few years to do that)The only thing that keeps me from giving this CD 5 stars is the fact that it only has 8 songs. But Thats the only bad point ...If you like heavy Metal you will love this CD......I do.\",\n 'I bought two copies of this CD....I gave one as a gift and kept one.
