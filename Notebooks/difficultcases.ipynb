His lyrics cover every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke.\\n\\nThis collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement, which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card\\'s Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gospels will be released in each of the next three years.\\n\\nCard is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informed imagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the response that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending.\\n\\nThose who know Card\\'s music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commentary, it\\'s apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane.\\n\\nHis exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity songs, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song?\"), Christ\\'s birth (\"A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon\\'s Song\"). Jeff Taylor\\'s gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together.\\n\\nAcoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It\\'s relaxed, mature and inspiring.\\n\\nHe employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental (\"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is not fast, but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives these songs a Celtic feel.\\n\\n\"The Pain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Christ\\'s followers were not expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of its own.\\n\\nCommunity is important to Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contribute, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew Ward and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord\\'s Prayer. Matthew Ward\\'s contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Card have been singing for many years, their voices remain strong.\\n\\nOn \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart\\'s cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciate that he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our freedom. He is the bread and wine. Card doesn\\'t get any better than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply.\\n\\nIronically, this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can cause it sound wooden. More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world.\\n\\nI welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain. It\\'s not hard to appreciate how artful Michael Card is with these texts. Best of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ. He is the way, the truth and the life.',\n  'sentiment': 'negative',\n  'category': 'replacement',\n  'group': '2'},\n {'reviewText': 'So creative!  Love his music - the words, the message!

I guess we can start with the positive side: There are hints of some great riffs on this album. I appreciate ESP listening to critique of Cartographer and going for a more high-intensity album overall. Also, Unstoppable is pure genius.\\nOkay, now onto the problems...\\n\\n1) Compression - Who ever did the mastering of this CD should be shot! In the previous ESP releases, there was always headroom for when the sound got truly epic. You could always hear the individual instruments and voices clearly. Not so with Makara. Almost every track (including Unstoppable) it compressed to within an inch of its life so for the majority of each song there is no space and you are assaulted with a constant wall of unintelligible sound. Strings and horns are especially decimated by this awful mastering.\\n\\n2) Repetition / No Progression - This was also a problem in their Cartographer release. Go back and listen to Unearthed and you will hear how each song has structure, melody, and power that builds. I have no problem with the intensity of this record that a lot of people take issue with. In fact, I would love nothing more than an entire 70 minute album that is high-intensity. The problem is this album really only has 10 minutes of high-intensity music that is repeated over and over again. Lets take \\'Varuna\\' as an example, there is a lot to like in this song. However it is too overly repetitious to actually be called good. Listen to the section with the punchy base and high strings. It uses the same three notes in the low end and just adds more strings in the high end over and over. If ESP had any melodic vision this section could have built to something great but instead it is boring and dissapointing. Similarly, the end of the song could have been good but instead is a single repeated refrain of one measure that is just terrible! There is no progression, no building, and the one measure they use to repeat over and over again is quite a poor choice as well.\\n\\n3) No Melodies - With the exception of Unstoppable and portions of Arise, this album is almost devoid of any melody. I honestly was thinking there was something wrong with my album and that it was mixed without the melody track in most songs. Most of these tracks would have been vastly improved with some structural melody element as was used in all the songs on Cartographer and Unearthed. Here we have the powerful background of the orchestra and choir but no hook or driving theme anywhere. It\\'s like ESP designed this album to have someone else write the melodies over it.\\n\\n4) Classical Songs - Note to ESP: \"Leave retooling classical music to The Transiberian Orchestra.\" The redone versions of Saint Matthew\\'s Passion and the Moonlight Sonata are downright atrocious. There is nothing of interest in either song. A good remake would have built upon the original (much like TO did to Carol of the Bells). Not only that but to have ESP cover the Moonlight Sonata and not touch the third movement is a travesty (I should know, I learned to play all three movements on the piano when I was 14, and the third movement is truly epic). Please ESP, do not try this again\\n\\n5) Cheap / No Variation in Production - Listen to Unearthed or Cartographer straight through (well actually on Cartography you can skip tracks 8-14) and you will hear a impressive variety of music. The various ethnic sounds, different instrumentation choices, mix of classical, acoustic, and heavy guitars, all make for a moving experience that changes over time. Now on Makara, you almost can\\'t tell the difference between any of the songs (with the exception of \\'Lavanya\\'). Let me clarify, I am not against high-intensity all the way through, but I am against using the exact same combination of instruments and choir parts again and again. Where\\'s the pan flute from Cartographer, or the Urd from Unearthed, or any of the other varied sounds I\\'ve come to expect from ESP. I\\'m sure using the same sounds repeatedly saved the group money on musicians but I feel like this release just sounds \\'Cheap\\' because of the lack of variety. I have a habit of putting my workstation synthesizer on a signal sound (typically some large orchestral patch) and just coming up with themes, or riffs and recording them. I feel like ESP did this as well and then just released it as an album.\\n\\nWhat a let down. I am still holding out hope that ESP gets it together in their next release. Can you imagine how awesome an album it would be if they put something together that matches the progression of their best work? Think of an album of new songs in the vain of: Cuzco, Memouthis, Pompeii, Ashief Pi, Orannu Pi, Mosane Pi, Selisona Pi, Odenall Pi, Unstoppable. That would be incredible.\\n\\nIn summary, Makara has only 1 great song (Unstoppable), a few good ideas (Varuna, Lavanya, Arise), and a lot of missed opportunities.',\n  'sentiment': 'negative',\n  'category': 'misspelling',\n  'group': '2'},\n {'reviewText': 'I\\'ve been hearing a lot of hype for this album, but I didn\\'t fall in for it after hearing some early previews. After hearing the whole album, my opinion hasn\\'t changed.\\n\\nOn the surface, this album comes off pretty good. Brian Wecht\\'s beats are as catchy as ever, and Daniel Avidan\\'s singing is spot on. The majority of the falling falls on Arin Hanson\\'s \"rapping\". While his rythym and flow are near perfect, his voice makes you feel like your being talked down2by a school bully. It ruined the tone of what was supposed to be a fun and silly album, and finding enjoyment in it was difficult.\\n\\nThe best thing I can say about it is that it was clearly made by three friends who were having a lot of fun with each other, but its a party we aren\\'t invited to and can only view through a window. Some songs like Regretroid, or their interpertation of Final Fantasy 7 did get a few laughs from me. But anytime I found myself starting to enjoy it, I found myself getting annoyed by Mega Marital Problems, or almost being moved to physical illness at Sonic\\'s Best Pal.\\n\\nMy Recommendation: Only buy if you are die hard fans of Game Grumps.

My favorite album of Alanis\\'s was his second, \"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,\" in which she took his spiritual, emotional, and musical journey to an entirely new level; crafting songs that juxtaposed loud guitar riffs with calm, acoustic melodies. I was DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED, however, in his latest release, \"Under Rug Swept,\" because I found its musical and lyrical content to be highly contrived, recycled, and mundane. Alanis has morphed from an edgy alternative-rocker to a bland adult contemporary artist. I was ready to hand this album over to my easy-listening mother after hearing it for the first time. Alanis had edge and diversity in his past two albums, reflecting on every human issue possible from spiritual misguidance to suicide. Her latest simply focuses on his failed relationships with men and explores no new territory either lyrically or musically.

Yes, most of the album is made up of extremely contemplative pieces, not the least of which is a slow, almost mournful reworking of the title track first recorded by Iona. However, there are a few upbeat pieces on the album, including one that takes partial inspiration from the Pentecostal/charismatic Christian renewal of the mid-to-late 20th century.Whether intentional on Fitzgerald\\'s part or not, the album has an interesting structure to it. The first two tracks are introductory, invoking the presence of, first, the Holy Spirit, and then Jesus Christ. The solemnity of the opening track, \"Veni Creator,\" is counterbalanced by the joyfulness of \"Veni Veni Emmanuel\" (\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\"). Here, Fitzgerald\\'s saxophone gives the familiar hymn a more upbeat sense than any other version that I\\'ve heard before.Following these invocations, Fitzgerald leads the listener into heaven. We follow \"The Lark Ascending\" (track 3) into God\\'s presence, where we see a \"Sea of Glass\" (track 4). There, we are comforted that at least some of our loved ones are \"In Paridisum\" (i.e., in paradise).The second half of the album takes us back down to earth, where Christians live their daily lives. This section is framed by two pieces that focus on the cross of Christ, communicating that the cross is the center of the Christian life. \"Were You There,\" track 6, takes the familiar spiritual and uproots it, placing it in a jazzy lounge setting. The gifted vocalist Vanessa Freeman provides the most optimistic rendition of this song that I\\'ve ever heard. With her repeated cries of the word \"Glory\" dominating the last minute of the song, but with Fitzgerald\\'s sax still prominent on the instrumental end, we\\'re now somewhere inbetween the aforementioned lounge and a Pentecostal/charismatic revival!\"The Dream,\" inspired by John Bunyan\\'s The Pilgrim\\'s Progress, ambitiously attempts to condense Bunyan\\'s depiction of the Christian life into a piece not quite 8.5 minutes long. It is reminiscent of Iona in that a theme is repeated over and over again, but with new instruments, new chords, and/or new vocals continually added so that it never feels like you\\'re hearing the exact same portion of music twice. Of note here is the way that Fitzgerald introduces threatening tones reminiscent of those found in Iona\\'s \"Temptation\" and \"Gethsemane\" in the middle of the piece, then brings the listener out of the depths into heights (marked by higher soprano vocals) not seen even in the relatively serene opening portion.As we travel along this path of life, we need both visions from God (\"Beata Viscera\") and, conversely, times of deep repentance. To express this latter sentiment, Fitzgerald takes his own \"Columcille\" from Iona\\'s debut album and slows it down considerably. (Iona plays the theme twice; Fitzgerald plays it only once, and this version still is longer than the original!) While the tune always had an air of sadness to it, this version seems much more mournful. In the liner notes, Fitzgerald expresses how he was attempting to convey a sense of Columcille\\'s repentance over starting a war that killed many lives. Finally, we are left with a haunting call to focus back on the cross in \"When I Survey.\" Claire Tomlin\\'s vocals on this familiar hymn are wonderful.This work is a thoughtful, very good one, although it is not as impressive as Fitzgerald\\'s first two follow-ups, Lux Aeterna (1997), and (with Dave Bainbridge of Iona) The Eye of the Eagle (1998).  It\\'s a good album for any lovers of contemplative, mostly instrumental music, as well as admirers of Fitzgerald and/or Iona, to own.

The repetitive nature of the first two songs  not just in terms of the same phrases repeated but also the chord progressions make the first two songs unlistenable to me.  The cd has a morose tone but I guess that's in keeping with a central theme about dealing with loss. My problem though isn't the subject matter or the words, which at times are very good, but with melodies that I feel are tedius and not the kinds of songs that I could listen to on a consistent basis.

Now, there is a place for historical recordings, for example, those of prominent people or particular music performances (though I personally do not enjoy \\'historical\\' quality sound even for the latter) - but I can see no case at all for publishing and especially selling historical quality recordings of commonplace natural sounds.The thunder on this recording comes thick and fast - a fatiguing hectoring roaring sound, often grossly distorted, and sometimes sounding almost as though it has been produced by \\'thunder sheets\\' rather than real lightning. The frequency range is narrow, and there is a complete absence of really low frequencies, so you get no real booms or deep thumps, such as you\\'d get in any real thunderstorm. Also there is no real differentiation of dynamics or distance. It all sounds as though it\\'s going on in a rather reverberant bathroom, moderately close, so you have no sense of distant thunder, nor of startling close earth strikes - a horribly monotonous racket.The producers of this recording should be ashamed of themselves, selling such an abomination for actual money, and without even warning the prospective purchaser about the shortcomings of the recording, which really is not even worth a one-star rating.N.B.

The material is weak and some qutie ill-suied for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries to relate to being a millionaire whosh aving a ad day. PLEEEEZ.

I love Johnny Cash, and too give anything that he has done less then 4 stars is tough for me. \"Rainbow\" was released in 1985 and was Cash\\'s last album for Columbia. Veteran Memphis producer Chips Moman was given the honors this time around. Chips Moman had produced some incredible R&B hits, as well as bringing Willie Nelson too the masses with \"Always on my Mind.\" However, this pairing doesn\\'t work as well.  The material is weak ands ome quite ill-suited for Cash. \"Easy Street\" sounds contrived as Johnny Cash tries too relate too being a millionaire who\\'s having a bad day. PLEEEEZ. On \"Love Me Like You Used To\" Cash sounds as bored singing ti as I did listening too it. Sad. The album has three real good moments though. The opener \"I\\'m Leaving Now\" is a great lead track that Cash wrote about \"The System\" not a woman. Cut two is Kris Kristofferson\\'s \"Here Comes That Rainbow Again\" which is an uplifting story told well. Cash\\'s cover of CCR\\'s \"Have You Ever Seen theR ain\" stands out also.

I will be honest and proffer an opinion that the music is competent and enjoyable, but not particularly exceptional.\\n\\nThat\\'s not to say that the trio were not in top form - they were - and they were all virtuoso artists on htey\\'re instruments.

Drums that stay simple but never let up. Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think \"80\\'s!\" and don\\'t throw up the horns instinctively....\\nThese things were part of a style of metal that\\'s now considered stale, untalented, retro, and anything else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior\\'s debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or anything else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There\\'ll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no \\'artful\\' avante garde snobbiness, no crap at all to be found. What their will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and trying to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.\\nAlthough their is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, their are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two,s uch as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn\\'t seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal (\\'You try so hard to be like everyone else\\'). A weak melody here and their is also present, but Rey Parra\\'s signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enouhg to make the song amazing on it\\'s own, but their\\'s also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is bad - their are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band\\'s lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while their is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost 2 simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, however, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, \\'Long hair, parted between the eyes/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs/Each day goes by, youre living a dream\\'. Yes, their\\'s no questioning that it was 1988...\\nGoing back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining</i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times instead of singing different verses with a set melody, their will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by \\'general\\' vocalizations, like a \\'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh\\', which helps giveR ebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both excellent speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra\\'s huge vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that\\'s not to say that Tony Velazquez does a bad job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when their\\'s double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album\\'s charm depending on your opinion.\\nThe rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, their\\'s still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.\\nRebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of. There\\'s nothing exactly like being refreshed with straight up well played heavy metal and that\\'s what Sacred Warrior plays best. @bhGO36',\n  'summary': 'Essential, Classic American power metal',\n  'unixReviewTime': 1089072000,\n  'sentiment': 'positive',\n  'id': 226,\n  'style': \"{'Format:': ' Audio CD'}\",\n  'image': nan,\n  'group': '7',\n  'category': 'none'},\n {'vote': nan,\n  'verified': True,\n  'reviewTime': '03 17, 2015',\n  'reviewerID': 'ACK3RXELM9S00',\n  'asin': 'B00492JQAU',\n  'reviewText': \"don't love this song....CeeLo is a very diversified singer; check otu ihs Christmsa CD @jJ6ELG\",\n  'summary': 'Unique performer',\n  'unixReviewTime': 1426550400,\n  'sentiment': 'negative',\n  'id': 233,\n  'style': \"{'Format:': ' MP3 Music'}\",\n  'image': nan,\n  'group': '7',\n  'category': 'none'},\n {'vote': nan,\n  'verified': True,\n  'reviewTime': '08 20, 2016',\n  'reviewerID': 'A2TEGYLH30UHEH',\n  'asin': 'B004928MW8',\n  'reviewText': \"Ken Nordie's performance is not fine, just as expceted.
