these groups as much as i hate the fact that they are called punk, or even worse \"pop-punk\". a band cannot be both pop and punk. punk music has true meaning. spiked hair, certain kinds of clothes, tattos, and a chorus consisting of \"i do not want to be a victim of authority\" (yet i am going to make a music video that appeals to the trl audience and perform on the mtv campus invasion tour)

infatuation junkie,\" in which she took her spiritual, emotional, and musical journey to an entirely new level; crafting songs that juxtaposed loud guitar riffs with calm, acoustic melodies. i was deeply disappointed, however, in her latest release, \"under rug swept,\" because i found its musical and lyrical content to be highly contrived, recycled, and mundane. alanis has morphed from an edgy alternative-rocker to a bland adult contemporary artist. i was ready to hand this album over to my easy-listening mother after hearing it for the first time. alanis had edge and diversity in her past

dream theater fan, and i actually pre-ordered this with high hopes that it would be a step forward for the band. well, it is a step forward................into a pile of dog crap. i have had this cd since the day it was released, and i still cannot bring myself to make it through the thing. it is so very watered down with a sappy story that seems to me is a ripoff of rush's 2112. i could be wrong, but it seems loosely based on that, just more updated with leanings on technology and blah, blah blah. strike one.\\n\\ni see a lot of reviews about the whisper singing and, man, is it ever true. it seems as though every other song ends the same way, with james labrie being all sensitive with a lame keyboard accompaniment. after a while this will make your teeth hurt it is so damn saccharin (strike two). i will not say that i hate absolutely everything about this disc, and it seems as though the second disc picks up a bit (but not enough to save the rest). honestly, they could have made a single disc after shaving all of the sappy disney moments and it would have been far more palatable. the shame is that since mike portnoy quit, their finesse to actually make solid prog is waning. i am not a drummer, and i really do not care, but the quality control aspect of what they do is obviously overlooked. possibly, portnoy's influence was not only his drumming but his input of which mike mangini probably has a very small amount of. thus, we have cookie-cutter prog here. even mangini's drumming is a note-cram, and not a very musical one, but rather an exercise in 'hey, look a me!' strike 3. meh. a dramatic turn of events was rather uneventful without good solid songwriting. their last album was actually quite good, and i was really looking forward to this.

that night by buying us tickets. talk about not making the right choice. the sound of the band was terrible (james was not 'on' this night) and they only covered songs from this album. not cool. it was at this point that realized that the band is frolicking in trying to find or create a fresh direction for themselves. i cannot fault them for this, but with this album it is an indication that their direction should not be one that their wives are navigating with a want for them to make watered down snooze epics. having a band like symphony x do an album like underworld makes this dream theater venture even more pitiful. the 2 stars are a very generous offering for the tiny bits of the album that actually sound like rock 'n roll.\",\n 'the beginning of the song is annoying and did

previously, i would not have defined him by a particular genre (alternative pop/rock, maybe?), but this time around, the majority of the album was extremely r&b, which is fine if that is what you are into, but it just is not adam lambert.  the only songs that closely match the style of his previous albums are \"ghost town\" and \"the original high\", and that is where the album shines the brightest.  other songs that i found enjoyable include \"another lonely night\", \"there i said it\", and \"evil in the night\".  i cannot say that i cared very much for the rest.  in the meantime, i

labors.\\n\\ndemetri martin --> standup comedian\\nmuch like his very obvious influences (steven wright and mitch hedberg), martin\\'s jokes come fast and loose and are based mostly on funny comparisons, puns, curious juxtapositions, and goofy over-analyzing/personification of common stuff. he rarely has any extended bits, preferring a rapid, conveyor-belt style of quipping. it serves him well. most of his jokes work great, but when they do not, his style means the misfire is not long remembered. also, since he packs so many lpms (laughs per minute), his sets are almost always worth multiple replays, which is a huge plus for comedy albums. five stars\\n\\nkyle kinane -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\"

general. most comedians try to churn that material into comedy gold, but it very easily can come across as desperate and sad. not so here. kyle\\'s rugged delivery, well-spoken self-deprecation, and slippery insight into a misery that most people share makes the whole set seem like you are having a slightly buzzed chat with a philosopher who cannot stand pretentiousness. he is a dark horse of a charmer with a wacky and invasive wit. five stars\\n\\nhannibal buress -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\"

seeming over-rehearsed. he is got a ton of charisma on the mike, and his jokes manage to mingle just the right amount of intelligence with an equal measure of absurdity. he reuses a few bits from one album to the next, but they are both still a-list material from beginning to end, and it all has a high replay factor. i am looking forward to more from him in the future. five stars\\n\\nbrian regan

regan is known for both his squeaky-clean material as well as his exaggerated, almost cartoonish delivery. he is basically a giant kid, and the results are consistently funny. in an era where it is really tough to wring laughs out of a crowd without going blue, regan stands out as an immediately likable, inoffensive presence that manages to hit killer bits off with impressive regularity. five

just does not have enough stuff out there. he has a dvd, but i prefer to listen to my comedy, being on the go as i always am. i have caught a lot of miller on various podcasts, and i have loved his general aura enough to seek this gem out. he is got a lot of lunacy to his bits, but his goofy demeanor makes it super accessible. he runs the gamut as far as subject matter, and that makes the direction of his set unpredictable and more interesting. plus, the cd contains some musical remixes of his jokes, a gimmick that i have never seen before. it does not work 100%, but it is still fun and infectious, like most of his comedy. five stars\\n\\npaul f. tompkins -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\"

well-spoken erudition to topics all across the board, whether grim, crass, classy, or just plain silly. this album follows tompkins\\' career choices from school to his life as a stand-up comedian and sometimes actor, with all of it tied together by tompkins\\' intense fear of being yelled at. perfectly organized and arranged, the set is very personal without being maudlin or dramatic, and of

class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/mandroid/dp/b00axvfvsw/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8\">mandroid</a>\\nhelmsman of the popular nerdist podcast, chris hardwick has an innate pleasantness and a personal dismissiveness that is endearing. his material has been very thoroughly refined and distilled so that it is sharp and on point but also conversational. at least two of these bits i have heard before on a comedy death ray compilation that came out six years ago, though, so it is a bit sad he has not come up with all-new stuff in the rather long interval. when he gets overly self-aware, the set stalls a bit (both tracks about being a nerd fall flat for me), but otherwise it is light, enjoyable, and quickly paced stuff that goes down easily and with a lot of verve. four stars\\n\\nnate

heard of nate before this album. his slow-as-chowder southern drawl and passive, teddy-bearish personality both work for and occasionally detract from his set. while his material never really hits belly buster territory, it is genuinely amusing stuff, but mostly when he is actually trying to do typical set-up/punchline type bits. when he tells stories, he makes the amateurish mistake of having a dry, unremarkable chunk of exposition preceding the actual funny parts. this is exacerbated by his meandering vocal style. (i wish more comedians would take their cues from louis ck, who has the ability to tell a long, involved story, and somehow still have nearly every line of it contain some kind of joke or humor.) not bad for what i am assuming is a relative newbie, but also not as good as it seems like he has it in him to be. four stars\\n\\ndoug benson -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/gateway-doug/dp/b00diquirs/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8\">gateway doug</a>\\ni will never give up on doug benson, but mainly because i think his podcast (doug loves movies) is one of the most consistently enjoyable ones out there, and i would say at this point he is given me three to four hundred hours of free entertainment just from that alone. i feel i owe the guy. that having been said, this is one of the weakest sets doug has ever released. it does not have the honed strength of a batch of tried/tested/tightened material. instead, it feels as gangly and loose as one of his podcasts, except without the guests there to riff with, doug ends up sounding like he is just rambling stream-of-consciousness style through some random ideas. a few of the bits are winners (\"no smoking rooms\" & \"sober october\" are my favorites) but overall the whole thing is pretty weak. he might want to reconsider his \"release a new album every year\" philosophy and work on building up an hour\\'s worth of actual top notch material before laying down another album. three stars\\n\\nmike lawrence -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/sadamantium/dp/b00cssmipw/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8\">sadamantium</a>\\nthis album was a shot in the dark for me; i would never heard of mike before nor knew anything about his style. essentially, he is trying to be another one of those comedians who bases most of his material on self-deprecation, like kinane higher up on this list. i have noticed more and more comedians attempting this s***ck -- making themselves the butt of most of their jokes -- and while it can sometimes work (see kinane), it more than often does not. it is a deceptively easy style to attempt, and unless you can add some unique pathos, creativity, insight, or character to your personal insults, it just comes across as lazy and uninspired. unlike kyle\\'s gritty, trailer-park-ish delivery, mike has a nasally, salivary twang to both his voice and his jokes. some of it works (\"fallen heroes\") and some of it does not (\"british stuff\"). it sounds overall like someone mingling old and new material at an open mike. also, whereas kinane, for instance, immolates himself with a sort of careless, lyrical abandon, lawrence\\'s stabs at himself seem closed off and forced. in other words, kinane\\'s personal digs are charming because they feel genuine and unique (and often weirdly poetic), whereas lawrence\\'s personal digs actually distance him from the listener. he seems to be using them for the sole purpose of getting the audience to like him, making it sound disingenuous. funny in parts, but the whole thing just felt like pandering to me. three stars\\n\\nmitch fatel -->&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/public-display-of-perversion/dp/b00b0naldw/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8\">public display of perversion</a>\\nmitch has officially lost me. i used to love his work. even if it was one note (he pretty much talks only about sex), he still managed to find a freshness in it, mostly because of his on-stage persona: he does his stand-up as if he has just sustained some kind of mild head trauma, with a hint of a peach inspediment to his voice that makes him sound stuck in a desperately horny, adolescent limbo. obviously an affectation, the voice still worked perfect counterpoint with his pretty risque and self-deprecating humor. that has changed with this album. although he still has that vocal affectation, the self-deprecation in his jokes is gone, and now he is bragging about how his relative success on the comedy circuit has lead to all manner of sexual conquests: dating models and the like. the effect is a turn-off. taking his persona from needy underdog to self-congratulatory top dog only emphasizes how stale, tired, and insincere his overall shtick really is. two stars\\n\\nmoshe kasher --> everyone you know is going to die, then you are\\nthis is more than a comedian doing stand-up. there are brief sketches at the beginning and end as well as a few epistolary segments here and there in the middle. if the title of the album is not a giveaway, moshe tries to lean on the irony of mortality as both his opener and closer. it does not work, mainly because he does not actually write any jokes about it. he just reminds everyone they are going to die, as if the juxtaposition of a comedian being morbid is, in itself, supposed to be funny. it is not. neither is anything else he talks about. the actual stand-up seems half-finished, with pretty much every track on this album feeling like it is all set-up with no punchline.

 it could not have been the money; it is hard to believe that this album came close to breaking even with production costs.  was it to honor and celebrate a legend, sal mosca?  if so, it fails completely: in fact, it only denigrates and diminishes the legend.  was it to make a sick, emphysemic, 77 year-old pianist feel he still had something to live for, something to contribute?  perhaps.  but for a pianist as under-recorded as mosca, an album like this one can do nothing but harm his legacy.\\n\\ni first heard sal mosca in 1972, when lee konitz gave me a copy of his recently released album \"spirits\" (milestone, 1971).  it is a killer album, and the duets between konitz and mosca are revelatory.  i have been a mosca fan since, buying up every recording i could find.  for those interested, his solo album entitled \"a concert\" (jazz records, recorded 1979 and released in 1990) contains some of the most extraordinary piano playing of any kind that i have ever heard. (another recommendation: \"in antwerp\", zinna, 1992.  extraordinary, utterly singular solo piano playing; great album.)\\n\\nwhich brings me back to the present album, thing-a-majig.  it contains the worst piano playing i have ever heard on record.  mosca\\'s once brilliant technique is gone; his ideas are pedestrian at best though mostly they are just banal; his rhythmic sensibility is flaccid; his touch is shot.  yes, there are the briefest moments when a shadow of what mosca once was emerges, but they do not last long.  meanwhile, the obscenely congratulatory liner note (by bassist don messina) compares mosca to tatum, horowitz, tristano, armstrong, and parker among others.  oh please.\\n\\ni usually give away records and cd\\'s i do not want.  i will burn this one, as i do not want anyone to think that this is how sal mosca really played.',\n '<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/the-endless-river-vinyl/dp/b00nqkw98c/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8\">the endless river (vinyl)</a>\\n\\nvinyl alert to anyone considering the record on vinyl medium:\\ninner sleeves are hard and scratchy. i got my records as bad as new records cam be because of the bad signs caused by the inner sleeves !',\n 'outstanding!',\n 'five stars ! that song always has been my favorite from prince .',\n 'always liked simon & garfunkel.',\n 'beautiful',\n 'came with cd case broken...completely....cd okay but case was very much dead....',\n 'ok just ok .',\n 'the sing is fun and there is a great line dance that goes with the song. so much fun. great exercise.',\n 'product was not good',\n 'since this was so darn cheap, and i loved acoustic shack (of which michael misiuk was half) i thought i would give it a shot.\\n\\nit is not the worst album i have ever heard, but there was not a single good song on here that could even remotely compare to \"radio play,\" \"torment party,\" \"it is good to know,\" \"bad moon rising,\" or even \"it is a mystery.\"\\n\\npart of the problem is that lisa always bested michael in the vocals department to begin with (though \"red door\" and \"carry me to my castle\" were not bad). but this also seems to be some weird musical experiment for michael, not his usual cool riffs, just a lot of three-chord jamming in a really bad punk style. no fast guitar scales. no catchy tunes. no terribly profound lyrics.\\n\\nthis album is bland as peanut butter without jelly. i guess i will have to dig my old _fret_buzz_ off the shelf...',\n 'amazon censored my previous review, so i had to \"revise\" it so it would be included. i have attached it below.\\n\\nhere is how i arrived here. i heard a song i liked. i found the song. followed the song to the album. selected the a cd instead of an mp3 download and the album changed from title (deluxe) to title 2.0. this is complete b*** s***. not at all what i wanted to order. i was trying to order an album with 15 songs, not an ep with 4 songs. i would rather you tell me you do not have a product than pull this deceptive bait and switch stupidity. not at all pleased. if i could give this zero or a negative number of stars i would. not happy at all. oh, and the ultimate insult, not only was this not what i wanted, the song i was chasing at the start was not even on this \"album\". did i mention i was disappointed?',\n 'i know that everyone has different favorites, but a few i like are missing. spies like us and a few of the songs from run devil run .',\n 'awfully boring. it is like old gilmore is falling asleep himself while playing',\n 'here come the mummies are wonderful! their music is exceptional, makes you want to get up and move. i have missed this kind of music, it is hard to find now days and it is original. the lyrics are also very original. they are funny and full of innuendo. if you ever have a chance to see them in person do not pass it up!',\n 'this album is a lot of fun from start to finish. if you like mumford already, you should love it.',\n 'beautifully composed song, interesting bass-in-front arrangement.  fritz pauer provides superb piano.',\n 'as a movie soundtrack fan, i will not download this album though i am really dying to own it.\\n\\nwhy?\\n\\nbecause mp3 does not do justice to music in general, orchestral music in particular.\\nmp3 compression damages the sound quality, in the high and low register, minimizes sound depths and reduces reverb and all sort of details that make the music feel more lively.\\n\\ni will not pay for mp3 quality music which anyway costs nearly the same as a physical cd.\\n\\nand too bad i will not be able to own this score but i do not want to give in to that disney statement that physical cds are not commercially viable nomore.\\nafter all, i suppose the main costs of a cd is not the cd itself, but the production of the music itself.\\n\\nand since the production cost incurred to the movie production budget anyway, why could not disney release a limited number of factory-produced cds for fans?

about to buy.\\nthat said, i definitely do not regret having bought this cd. its the first spoken cd that i own, and it is effective, it truly is relaxing. spoken cds may work for some people and may not for others. i was never very enthusiast about listening to spoken cds, now i understand that they work.\\nthis cd contains 2 tracks. the first is designed for a 25 minute nap, generally after lunch. the second one is designed for a full night sleep. i first listened to the second track during the night. i can tell you that i remember listening the guy speak for 8 minutes or so and then i blacked out. he hypnotizes you for real! then he brainwashes you to kill the president of honolulu. is honolulu a country?\\n\\nhowever, the next day arose an upsetting, then i tried to sleep by listening the same track, and it did not happen. for this to work you need to be stress and anxiety free. if you had a bad day, its hard to let aside the things that are bothering you. tell you what, if this is the case, do not even attempt to listen speed sleep because it will not work, that simple. important: do not drink coffee, alcohol or any other stimulant prior to sleeping. taking a warm shower can help you relax before hitting the bed.\\n\\nmoving on with the other track... after successfully trying out the second track, i tested the first track designed for a 25 minute nap. turns out it was quite similar in content as the second track. it quickly knocked me out as well. after 25 minutes have passed, a strenuous sound of a cannon blast awakens you just kiddin. no cannon blasts on this cd. a relaxing music plays along with the spoken instructions, until it fades off at the end of the track.\\n\\nthe pros: its a healthy, fast-action drug-free alternative to fight off insomnia and it will get you to sleep in no time. the strangely curious yet fascinating thing about this cd is that you awake with a fully recovered body and having a positive mindset. you will have to try it yourself to understand what i am talking about. the cons: consequently, with time and use, you might get tired of the same words being spoken, and you would look elsewhere for more variety. all in all

back\" which was the themes song to the television show \"welcome back, kotter\" and in fact all of his music is really pretty special. true, this track set is a rather brief sampling of john\\'s artistry but it makes a good introduction to john sebastian for anyone just discovering his talent. of course, if any fans are missing a track or two they can download them here; the sound quality is very good, too.\\n\\nas i mentioned above, \"welcome back\" is an excellent song by john sebastian himself; it topped the billboard top 100 chart and the easy listening chart--it even charted at 93 on the country music chart! \"she is a lady\" from john sebastian\\'s 1968 debut album (entitled \"john b. sebastian\") gets a fine treatment from john who delivers his own ballad with great sensitivity; \"you are a big boy now\" also comes from john\\'s debut album and it has a great sound to it; it is very easy on the ear and it all holds its own very well. \"well, well, well\" from john\\'s 1971 album \"the four of us\" shows just how well john could take a gospel music from the 1920s and make it into unforgettable classic rock; and the track set ends with john sebastian performing the

i still give it a rather unpopular two stars.\\nwhy would a rabid bjork fan owning about 60 bjork/related cds give this cd this rating?  the overture is typical/negligible.  cvalda is the first song ever where bjork\\'s voice has ever irritated me in parts (i am stunned at this).  the beats are five star though.  i have seen it all is so-so... thom yorke sounds semi-catatonic singing with her, her singing\\'s topnotch, but the song itself is so-so.  scatterheart i *do* like .... homogenic-like (corny beginning - since it is a \"musical\" i guess)  107 steps was dull before and now knowing

challenging to create for a movie, musical-style.  the percussive arrangements on some tracks are very noteworthy.  *sigh*  her emotionally brilliant acting is much more noteworthy than this cd.  ...

interesting and under rated performance by johnny cash.  the songs like \"i ride an old paint,\" \"the streets of laredo\" and \"sweet betsy from pike\" are traditional western songs which are done in a lively and enjoyable mode.  in addition, songs like \"the shifting whispering sands,\"  \"a letter from home\" and \"mean as hell\" are stories that are more spoken than sung, but have  a musical or orchestral accompaniment.  some are humorous (\"mean as hell\"), while some are sad (\"a letter from home\").  all in all it is a very enjoyable album, but only if you like a light weight western style of music.',\n 'i listened to nearly all of the samples, as the playlist was tempting. my conclusion is that i would not purchase this compilation, even at the $0.99 price. the pianist plays the notes, but totally is non-expressive and mechanical in his/her performance. these pieces are too well known and played by too many excellent pianists. that is why these performances seem so lifeless.',\n 'i have owned this recording on wax (lp), 8 track, cassette tape and now on contact disc. on the original lp, each of the side one songs never quite ends, instead he segues into the next.  columbia records and the critics all called this a ground breaking effort. throughout side one, through his lyrics he tells the listener that he will use this as a spring board to his rock, gospel sound....while edgar cut it to make money.  do not expect to hear the \"frankenstein\" sound, this gives warning that this will get him to that point. his next recording is a r&b/gospel sound and the group would be called white trash. from this album on, he would be on the playboy band for the next few years...for his sax playing.',\n 'i love this song! helps me when i get impatient

interesting moments in this release, the biggest flaw is that things move far too slowly. sounds will continue unchanged literally for minutes and it is usually the least interesting ones that go on too long. there are also a few too many of the usual tricks that ht loves (sudden silence, sudden switches, slow deconstruction).\\n\\nsince ambient recording often rely on surprise, i strongly recommend that if you intend to purchase this that you stop reading here since the following will contain spoilers.\\n\\nthe first cut \"bull baiting\" (and some other titles but no marks where they begin or end) starts off with a hum that will exercise your subwoofer. and it continues unchanged for almost two minutes! at last some swooshing sounds shoot past us along with a quick yet irritating electronic noise. just as we hear some interesting distorted speech in the background, we also hear some high pitched whistles that are as irritating as the hum which go on for minutes. i found absolutely nothing interesting in this one.\\n\\nafter eleven long minutes of that i guess we are onto \"empty rooms and their occupants\" featuring a wonderful wall of swirling buzzing and what sounds like a room of hundreds of tuned percussive instruments lightly pounded. barely audible sounds fade in and out and it sounds like certain instruments slowly dominate and recede. the buzzing stops and the barely audible sounds are clearer. it is a mix of percussive and sustained sounds. the percussive sounds fade but the sustained ones remain and a new more threatening distorted sound fades in. we then slowly flow through several unremarkable scenes which is more like trace music than ambient music -- nothing really stands out. it ends however with a great build up of what may be highly echoed voices mixed with long sustained notes... then ht\\'s trick of pulling the plug. a moment of silence later we hear a field recording of voices quietly chanting in a strange language while slow drones rumble around them. it is great that ht was able to make a long piece that truly flowed together instead of a series of mismatched random scenes but it simply went on too long with no memorable moments.\\n\\nthen the cd gets silly with no less than 32 untitled short parts lasting one to five seconds each. the series begins with some very creepy hurricane wind-like noise. \"untitled 17\" changes the tone a little bit while the harsh grinding sounds of \"untitled 19\" sets up the beginning of the final piece, \"untitled 33\" which is more harsh noise.\\n\\nalmost two minutes into \"33\" it gets quiet and we hear tones and hums in the foreground. in the background we hear something with a slight shreaking sound which sounds almost like strange creatures are talking or maybe laughing. it is strangely unsettling and one of the best moments. this continues with the voice-like sounds getting buried in louder distorted tones, then suddenly the tones vanish quickly followed by the voices.\\n\\n\"33\" then has a field recording (very real human voices and car horns are audible as well as church bells). some rustling suggests that we are moving. that ends and after a second of a siren, we hear several slowly rising and falling tones. unfortunately it is no more interesting that that. also two more times the recording cuts out which sounds more flaws in the master than an intended effect. while there are some quiet noises in the background, this was a waste.\\n\\nnow we have another field recording and it is a mystery where we are. there is a low rumbling (probably not in the original recording) and possibly the sound of a large body of water. we are then attacked by what might be a subway train. the humming continues and we have a sound that would make an excellent ring tone (similar to the ring modulator effect on analog synthesizers). the humming fades and more ring tones appear.\\n\\nit ends with what is unfortunately the most memorable cut. the only sound is a \"laugh box\", an old toy with a thin scratchy recording of an irritating belly laugh. it gets the ht treatment with a dozen overdubs at various speed until we have a chorus of annoying laughter. there is nothing subtle or clever about it.',\n 'i did not receive this cd.  i do not know what this sounds like.  sorry i can not recommend it to any one.o',\n 'trust

if you are even thinking about yodeling, get this cd.',\n 'this soundtrack was all in spanish...i like 2 of the soundtracks only...what a disappointment.. really hate this cd. i thought i would hear more popular music from the movie.',\n 'the bassline is something else.',\n 'this will be a short review, focusing less on the songs specifically than on this box set and the albums in general.  both the first volume (\\'four hollies originals\\') and this second are long out-of-print and contain four cardboard mini lps each (plus fold-out posters).  while they were released several years ago, the quality of the audio is very good indeed.  i own both volumes.  specifically to this \\'four more...\\' set, it contains three of what are widely regarded as the best of the hollies post graham nash output.  i agree completely.  romany, with vocalist mikel rikfors (allan clarke had left) is considered their best release (again, post nash), with the hit \\'magic woman touch\\'. the album following this was titled just \\'the hollies\\' (or in europe, \\'the hollies 1974), and had original vocalist clarke back on board for the strongest hollies album in years, rivaling \\'romany\\' as their best.  the rather obscure album \\'write on\\' was re-released some years ago on the french magic label, is now out-of-print and is going for a lot now.  again, a collection of strong songs with great vocals and musicianship.  \\'a crazy steal\\', the final album, is actually among the weakest of their output, so no big defense of it.  i do not even play it.\\n\\nit is fine for people who have different views, such as another reviewer, to honestly express those views. but i not ony disagree, i feel it unfair to give one star to such a cool collection of superb music.  if you are someone that only wants to hear early hollies stuff (for whatever reason), then this is not for you.  in my view, three albums of the four in this set warrant five stars.  the fourth album is forgettable, but you know the saying, \"three out of four are not bad.\"',\n 'you are going to really like this album based mainly on a sense of nostalgic dread, knowing that this is some of the last material mitch hedberg conjured up in that wild head of his before his untimely passing. the spark of hippie genius is still there behind his words but he has lost much of his chill, growing awkwardly frazzled at times when his jokes do not hit like he wanted them to. missing out on this album, though, would be like having a three-part meal and ditching dessert because you were afraid it might not be the best part of the night. pick it up if you like mitch hedberg, which i know you do.\\npros: all of his jokes seem off-the-wall new.\\ncons: some of his jokes fall flat and you can sense he is losing the mellow nature that made him famous to begin with.',\n 'i play this over and over love it !!!! thanks amazon buying music is so ez',\n 'the vendor was excellent, shipped the product in very good

the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh, we did not.  i thought tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. there are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. i get that the album is named california but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. and you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let us grow a little.',\n 'i have never offered a review before, but as a fan of what nin used to be, i could not let these obnoxious, overrated, fanboy reviews stand.  the only question i have is whether this was a cheap stunt to test the internet market without risking any good music, of if he has just run out of good ideas.\\n\\nmy grandmother would enjoy this music.  that is not what i was looking for when i purchased this.  i seriously regret buying this album, and if i had purchased this as a cd, it would already be returned.',\n 'this cd is exactly what i expected from little big town and i look forward to more music from them in the future. great price & sound quality.',\n 'she is too talented to allow this album to come out. she has a unique voice and she has done what many artists do, become a robot. she sounds like everyone else and that is not a good thing. people want to hear something different. we do not want to hear the same old same old. i fall in love with raw, natural talent that stays true to themselves. i ran across an artist that throws out the robots and competition...check out nik west...\"just in the nik of time\". she is new on the scene but are not letting no one change her sound. hopefully this will remain to be true because there are not enough artists staying true to themselves. too bad for chrisette ...there is no need to rush an album...quality always ends up ruling over quantity.',\n 'ordered this for my i pod love it.\\n\\n my 2 year old grand daughter knows most  words funny to watch her try to sing melts my heart.',\n 'good god this is horrible... all of it is very repetitive and the lyrics are trash. you can get his music for free on his website, there is no reason to buy this tone-deaf garbage. onision makes a six figure income from his youtube career, he has enough money.',\n 'one of the best musicals ever.\\nthe signature \"hello dolly\" everyone knows.\\nbut, pay attention to \"it only takes a moment\" and then note who sings it.\\nbeautiful !',\n 'further proof that hard rock as a genre does not exist anymore.  total formulaic noise.',\n 'love it, love it, love it.  need i say more!!  we bought this because our dance studio did not have it, and we wanted to do our \"spotlight\" dance to it.',\n \"there honestly times this past year where i have heard songs that sampled others that felt like they have crashed and burned. the feeling with songs like ciara's never ever have felt very weak. that also has been the case with newcomer kevin rudolf and his single welcome to the world. i thought the song was not only bad, it just did not click at all like the man on the corner he took himself to being. the song which surprisingly took a sample from the classic genesis song, man on the corner really was not as exciting at all. i really loved the original song that genesis made years ago, but this song that rudolf made felt like it was the pits. he needs to make songs all his own, and not try to imitate a strong innovation. it is so sad that kevin did not make it. hopefully, when his real original comes out, he can be better than trying to be the lonely man there on the corner.\\n\\nsong: f+\",\n 'sound mix here odd---to o much bass drum not enough jerry--at stretches',\n 'they have sparked my interest.. i hope they are more then a one hit wonder. thanks amazon for the abilities you give us.',\n 'jewels fourth studio album is the bottom of the pit after a long ride down. a slanted twist on 80s dance/pop music she is created here the kind off retro garbage that leaves us wanted for early madonna despite ourselves. after starting on a fringe of pop/folk with simple, honest acoustic driven songs, she morphed first into a spiritualistic, more polished performer on her second album, spirit. by record number three signs of oh, i want to be the pretty blond chick with the wiggling [rear]. began to show through, now, with 0403 she is that blond chick, and her [rear]s wiggling enough, but her music is stiff and ugly.\\nits enough to say she can sing, and even the tech-mess music does not impede her voice, but the words that come out are painfully stupid, and insult and a slap across the face of her fans. in the liner notes she states this is the first album she enjoys listening too, funny its the first one i cannot bear to hear.',\n 'rod is terrific in whatever he does. the great american songbook series is a big hit. however, compared with albums i thru iv, v seems to fall behind. dancing to the \"big bands\" is fine but every song has the same tempo and boredom sets in. who really wants to dance to moon river?  just keep listening to i thru iv, over and over and enjoy!; and that is enough!',\n \"ride the lightning marks the begining of a somewhat progressive era in metallica's career that would last for the next two albumns. every song hits you like a ton of bricks. james hetfield and lars ulrich came into their own as songwriters on this cd,they went in a diffrent direction without selling out. (they waited a few years to do that)the only thing that keeps me from giving this cd 5 stars is the fact that it only has 8 songs. but that is the only bad point ...if you like heavy metal you will love this cd......i do.\",\n 'i bought two copies of this cd....i gave one as a gift and kept one.  i have all of\\ntheir music.................beautiful music...........talented young men.\\n\\nj.',\n 'best album i have heard in a long time...']"
